# HexToImage
A program to parse a hexadecimal string into an image

# How it Works
A 6 digit hexadecimal string can be broken down into 3 groups of 2 digits, one being red, then green, then blue, giving 256 (16^2) choices for each component. This adds to be a possible 16.8 million colors (hence why lights will say 16.8 million colors). This program takes in a long hexadecimal string, breaks it into groups of 6 and then uses that hex code to create an image!
